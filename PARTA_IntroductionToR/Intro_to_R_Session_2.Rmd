 \frametitle{Introduction to R}
 Source: R project website (http://www.r-project.org)
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project
 which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories
 (formerly AT\&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 
 \item R can be considered
 as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much
 code written for S runs unaltered under R.
 \end{itemize}
 

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
 time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
 \item The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology,
 and \texttt{R} provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
 \item One of \texttt{R}’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be
 produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 
 \end{itemize}
 

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Great care has been
 taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
 \item \texttt{R} is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General
 Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms
 and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 
 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \texttt{R} is a programming environment that
 \begin{itemize}
 \item uses a well-developed but simple programming language
 \item allows for rapid development of new tools according to user demand
 \item these tools are distributed as packages, which any user can download to customize the R
 environment.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Comprehensive R Archive Network}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Base \texttt{R} and most \texttt{R} packages are available for download from the \textbf{Comprehensive R Archive Network}
 (CRAN) cran.r-project.org. 
 \item Base \texttt{R} comes with a number of basic data management,
 analysis, and graphical tools 
 \item \texttt{R}s power and flexibility, however, lie in its array of packages
 (currently more than 6,000!)
 \end{itemize}

 \item[1.2] Command Line Interface     
 \item[1.3] The Assignment operator

 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.1 Installing R}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{R} is very easily installed by downloading it from the CRAN website. Installation usually takes
 about 2 minutes. 
 \item When installation of R is complete, the distinctive \texttt{R} icon will appear on your
 desktop. To start \texttt{R}, simply click this Icon. 
 \item It is common to re-install \texttt{R} once a year or so. The
 current version of \texttt{R}, version 3.1.2 was released quite recently.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 
 \frametitle{1.2 Command Line Interface}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item When you start \texttt{R}, the command line interface window will appear on screen. This is one
 of many windows in the \texttt{R} environment, others including graphical output windows, or script
 editors. 
 \item \texttt{R} code can be entered into the command line directly. 
 \item Alternatively code can be saved
 to a script, which can be run inside a session using the \texttt{source()} function.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The assignment operator is used to assign names to particular values. 
 \item Historically the assignment
 operator was ) a ``\texttt{$<-$}”. 
 \item The assignment operator can also be the equals sign "=". (This is valid as of \texttt{R}
 version 1.4.0.)
 
 \item Both will be used, although, you should learn one and stick with it. Many long term \texttt{R}
 users prefer the arrow approach. 
 \end{itemize}

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item You can also use $->$ as an assignment operator, reversing the
 usual assignment positions. (This is actually really useful).
 \item Commands are separated either by
 a semi colon or by a newline.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 \textbf{The Up and Down Keys}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Before we continue, try using the up and down keys, and see what happens. 
 \item Previously
 typed commands are re-presented, and can be re-executed.
 \end{itemize}
 

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator }
 \textbf{objects}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R stores both data and output from data analysis (as well as everything else) in \textbf{objects}.
 \item The variables we have created so far are objects. 
 \item A list of all objects in the current session can
 be obtained with \texttt{ls()}.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{1.3.1 Reserved Words - Bad names for Objects}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Some names are used by the system, e.g.\texttt{T, F,q,c} etc . 
 \item Avoid using these. (This is the rule I broke earlier on)
 \item Also avoid using command names like \textbf{mean} and \textbf{sum}
 \end{itemize}
 
 
  
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.4 Commenting}
 For the sake of readability, it is good practice to comment code. The \# character at the
 beginning of a line signifies a comment, which is not executed. Lines of hashtags can be used
 to identify the beginning and end of code segments
 \begin{figure}

 \end{figure}
 

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.5 Defining and Naming Variables}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item A convention is to use define a variable name with a capital letter (R is case sensitive). 
 \item This
 reduces the chance of overwriting in-build \texttt{R} functions, which are usually written in lowercase
 letters. 
 \item Commonly used variable names such as x, y and z (in lower case letters) are not “reserved”.
 \end{itemize}
 \textbf{Camel Case}
 \begin{framed}
 \texttt{camelCase}
 
 \texttt{variableName}
 
 \texttt{AlsoCamelCase}
 \end{framed}


 %==============================================================================================%

 
 \frametitle{1.6 Help Functions}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  Help files for R functions are accessed by preceding the name of the function with ?\\  (e.g. \texttt{?sort}
 ). 
 
 \item Alternatively you can use the command \texttt{help()} (e.g. \texttt{help(sqrt)} )
 \end{itemize}
 

 %==============================================================================================%

 
 \frametitle{1.6 Help Functions}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item A HTML document appears on screen with information on the function typed in. 
 \item As well
 as the list of arguments that the particular function accepts, and how to specify them, there is
 example code at the bottom of the file. 
 \item These code segments are often invaluable in learning
 how to master the function.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{1.7 The \texttt{help.start()} command}
 As mentioned by the text on the main console, the \texttt{help.start()} command can be usd to
 access detailed help documentation that comes as part of the installation.

 \frametitle{1.8 Basic Maths Operations}
 \vspace{-0.5cm}
 The most commonly used mathematical operators are all supported by \texttt{R}. \\ \bigskip Here are a few
 examples:
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
 $5 + 3 \ast 5$ &  Note the order of operations.\\\hline
 log (10) & Natural logarithm with base e=2.718282 \\\hline
 log(8,2) & Log to the base 2 \\\hline
 $4^2$ & 4 raised to the second power \\\hline
 7/2 & Division \\\hline
 factorial(4) & Factorial of Four \\\hline
 sqrt (25) & Square root \\\hline
 abs (3-7) & Absolute value of 3-7 \\\hline
 pi & The mysterious number \\\hline
 exp(2) & exponential function \\\hline
 
 \end{tabular} 

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 
 \texttt{R} can be used for many mathematical operations, including
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Set Theory
 \item Trigonometry
 \item Complex Numbers
 \item Binomial Coefficients
 \end{itemize}
 Set Theory is always useful to know (Monty Hall Problem). We will not go into any of the others in great detail today.
