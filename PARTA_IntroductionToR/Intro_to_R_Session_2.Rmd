 \frametitle{Introduction to R}
 Source: R project website (http://www.r-project.org)
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project
 which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories
 (formerly AT\&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 
 \item R can be considered
 as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much
 code written for S runs unaltered under R.
 \end{itemize}
 

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
 time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
 \item The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology,
 and \texttt{R} provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
 \item One of \texttt{R}’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be
 produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 
 \end{itemize}
 

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Great care has been
 taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
 \item \texttt{R} is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General
 Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms
 and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{What is R?}
 \texttt{R} is a programming environment that
 \begin{itemize}
 \item uses a well-developed but simple programming language
 \item allows for rapid development of new tools according to user demand
 \item these tools are distributed as packages, which any user can download to customize the R
 environment.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Comprehensive R Archive Network}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Base \texttt{R} and most \texttt{R} packages are available for download from the \textbf{Comprehensive R Archive Network}
 (CRAN) cran.r-project.org. 
 \item Base \texttt{R} comes with a number of basic data management,
 analysis, and graphical tools 
 \item \texttt{R}s power and flexibility, however, lie in its array of packages
 (currently more than 6,000!)
 \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item[1.1] Installing \texttt{R}      
 \item[1.2] Command Line Interface     
 \item[1.3] The Assignment operator     
 \item[1.4] Commenting      
 \item[1.5] Defining Variables     
 \item[1.6] Help Functions      
 \item[1.7] The \texttt{help.start()} command     
 \item[1.8] Basic Maths Operations     
 \item[1.9] Basic \texttt{R} Editor      
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.1 Installing R}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{R} is very easily installed by downloading it from the CRAN website. Installation usually takes
 about 2 minutes. 
 \item When installation of R is complete, the distinctive \texttt{R} icon will appear on your
 desktop. To start \texttt{R}, simply click this Icon. 
 \item It is common to re-install \texttt{R} once a year or so. The
 current version of \texttt{R}, version 3.1.2 was released quite recently.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{1.2 Command Line Interface}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item When you start \texttt{R}, the command line interface window will appear on screen. This is one
 of many windows in the \texttt{R} environment, others including graphical output windows, or script
 editors. 
 \item \texttt{R} code can be entered into the command line directly. 
 \item Alternatively code can be saved
 to a script, which can be run inside a session using the \texttt{source()} function.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The assignment operator is used to assign names to particular values. 
 \item Historically the assignment
 operator was ) a ``\texttt{$<-$}”. 
 \item The assignment operator can also be the equals sign "=". (This is valid as of \texttt{R}
 version 1.4.0.)
 
 \item Both will be used, although, you should learn one and stick with it. Many long term \texttt{R}
 users prefer the arrow approach. 
 \end{itemize}

 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item You can also use $->$ as an assignment operator, reversing the
 usual assignment positions. (This is actually really useful).
 \item Commands are separated either by
 a semi colon or by a newline.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{The Up and Down Keys}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Before we continue, try using the up and down keys, and see what happens. 
 \item Previously
 typed commands are re-presented, and can be re-executed.
 \end{itemize}
