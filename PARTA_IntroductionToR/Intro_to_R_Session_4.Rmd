 \frametitle{1.13 Coming Unstuck}
 \Large
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  If you are having trouble with a piece of code that is currently compiling , all you have to do is press ESC, just like many other computing environments.
 \end{itemize}  

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.14 Quitting the R environment}
 As the front page text indicates, all you have to do to quite the workspace is to type in \texttt{q()}.
 You will then be prompted to save your work.

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.15 Data Objects}
 As mentioned previously, R saves data as \textbf{objects}. Examples of data objects are
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Vectors
 \item Lists
 \item Dataframes
 \item Matrices
 \end{itemize}
 The simple objects we have created previously are simply single element vectors.

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.16 Listing all items in a workspace}
 To list all items in an R environment, we use the \texttt{ls()} function. This provides a list of all data
 objects accessible. Another useful command is \texttt{objects()}.

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.17 Removing items}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Sometimes it is desirable to save a subset of your workspace instead of the entire workspace.
 \item One option is to use the \texttt{rm()} function to remove unwanted objects right before exiting your R
 session; another possibility is to use the \texttt{save()} function.
 \end{itemize}

 
 
 
 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{1.19 Saving and Loading R Data Objects}
 In situations where a good deal of processing must be used on a raw dataset in order to prepare
 it for analysis, it may be prudent to save the R objects you create in their internal binary form.
 One attractive feature of this scheme is that the objects created can be read by R programs
 running on different computer architectures than the one on which they were created, making it
 very easy to move your data between different computers. Each time an R session is completed,
 you are prompted to save the workspace image, which is a binary file called .RData in the
 working directory.

 %==============================================================================================%

 Whenever R encounters such a file in the working directory at the beginning of a session,
 it automatically loads it making all your saved objects available again. So one method for
 
 saving your work is to always save your workspace image at the end of an R session. If you
 would like to save your workspace image at some other time during your R session, you can use
 the save.image() function, which, when called with no arguments, will also save the current
 workspace to a file called .RData in the working directory.

 \begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{help()}
 \item \texttt{summary()}
 \item \texttt{help.start()}
 \item \texttt{apropos()}
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{2.2 Changing GUI options}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item We can change the GUI options using the GUI preferences option on the Edit menu.
 \item  (Important
 when teaching R) 
 \item A demonstration will be done in class.
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{2.3 Colours}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item R supported a massive number of colours.
 \item Type in colours() (or colors()) to see what colours
 are supported.
 \end{itemize}

  %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{2.4 Use of the Semi-Colon Operator}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The semi-colon operator at the end of each line of code is not necessary in general, but using it
 overcomes errors due to copying and pasting from document soft copies. 
 \item It is also useful for compacting multiple short statements onto a single line.
 \item In other programming
 languages, such as Octave, using the semicolon in this way has a distinct purpose.
 \end{itemize}

 %==============================================================================================%

 \frametitle{2.5 The \texttt{apropos()} Function}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item This function is very useful for determining what functions are available for a particular topic,
 although the process requires a great deal of trial and error. 
 \item Suppose we are looking for a
 command to print out the session information. 
 \item We would use a very short string (e.g. \textbf{essio})
 that would plausibly be part of useful function names.
 \end{itemize}
