 \frametitle{R Packages}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  
 Some examples of packages are Actuar, written for actuarial science, and
 QRMlib, which complements the Quantitative Risk Management The command library()
 lists all the available packages. 
 
 \item To load a particular package, for example MASS, we would
 write
 \end{itemize}\begin{framed}
 \texttt{library(MASS)}

 \frametitle{Packages}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The CRAN package repository features 6107 available packages. 
 \item Packages contain
 various functions and data sets for numerous purposes, e.g.
 \textbf{\textit{ggplot2}} package, \textbf{\textit{AER}} package, \textbf{\textit{survival}} package, etc.
 \item Some packages are part of the basic installation. Others can be
 downloaded from CRAN.
 \item To access all of the functions and data sets in a particular package,
 it must be loaded into the workspace. 
 \item For example, to load the
 \textbf{\textit{ggplot2}} package:
 \end{itemize}
 
 \begin{framed}
 \texttt{install.packages(ggplot2)}
 
 \texttt{library(ggplot2)}
 \end{framed}

 \frametitle{4.2 Using and Installing packages}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Many packages come with R. To use them in an R session, you need to load the package, as
 previously demonstrated.
 \item Some packages are not automatically installed when you install R but they need to be downloaded
 and installed individually. 
 \item We must first install them using the install.packages()
 function, which typically downloads the package from CRAN and installs it for use. (follow the
 instructions as indicated).
 \end{itemize}

 \frametitle{4.2.1 Version of R}
 Many packages will require you to have the most recent version of R and also other packages.
 It is a good idea to update regularly.
