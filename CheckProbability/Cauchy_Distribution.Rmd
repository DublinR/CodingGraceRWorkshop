Cauchy Distribution

 

This is an interesting pdf, because strictly speaking, its mean does not exist and its variance is infinite. Given our definition of mean,

 

we find that this integral does not exist because the separate integrals for   and  do not exist. However, if we allow a ``principal value'' integration, where the limits are taken simultaneously, we see that the integral for  will cancel the integral for  and the mean is zero, consistent with a graphical interpretation of this pdf, as depicted in Figure 8. However, if we try to compute the variance, we find:
