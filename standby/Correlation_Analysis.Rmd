\item{Correlation Analysis}
Compute the Pearson correlation for the dependent variable with the respective independent variables.  
As part of your report, mention the confidence interval for the correlation estimate
Choose the independent variables with the highest correlation as your candidate variables.
For these independent variables, perform a series of simple linear regression procedures.
\begin{verbatim}
lm(y~x1)
lm(y~x2)
\end{verbatim}
Comment on the slope and intercept estimates and their respective p-values. Also comment on the coefficient of determination (multiple R squared). 
Remember to write the regression equations.
Perform a series of multiple linear regressions, using pairs of candidate independent variables.
\begin{verbatim}
lm(y~x1 +x2)
lm(y~x2 +x3)
\end{verbatim}
Again, comment on the slope and intercept estimates, and their respective p-values.
In this instance, compare each of the models using the coefficient of determinations. Which model explains the data best?
\subsection{Analysis of residuals}
Perform an analysis of regression residuals ( you can pick the best regression model from last section).
Are the residuals normally distributed?
	Histogram /  Boxplot / QQ plot / Shapiro Wilk Test
Also you can plot the residuals to check that there is constant variance.
\begin{verbatim}
y=rnorm(10)
x=rnorm(10)
fit1=lm(y~x)
res.fit1 = resid(fit1)
plot(res.fit1)
\end{verbatim}

# Colour points and choose plotting symbols according to a levels of a factor
plot(Cars93$Weight, Cars93$EngineSize, col=as.numeric(Cars93$Type),
pch=as.numeric(Cars93$Type))

# Adds x and y axes labels and a title.
plot(Cars93$Weight, Cars93$EngineSize, ylab="Engine Size",
xlab="Weight", main="My plot")
# Add lines to the plot.
lines(x=c(min(Cars93$Weight), max(Cars93$Weight)), y=c(min(Cars93$EngineSize),
max(Cars93$EngineSize)), lwd=4, lty=3, col="green")
abline(h=3, lty=2)
abline(v=1999, lty=4)
# Add points to the plot.

\subsubsection{Two Sample t test}

The two-sample t test is used to test the hypothesis that two samples may
be assumed to come from distributions with the same mean.

The theory for the two-sample t test is not very different in principle from
that of the one-sample test. Data are now from two groups, $x_{11}, . . . , x_{1n1}$
and $x_{21}, . . . , x_{2n2}$ , which we assume are sampled from the normal distributions
$N(µ_{1}, \sigma^{1}_{2} )$ and
$N(µ_{2}, \sigma^{2}_{2} )$, and it is desired to test the null hypothesis
$\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$. You then calculate

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2}}{S.E.(\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2})}
\]






\section{Introduction to \texttt{R}}
\texttt{R} consists of a base package and many additional packages
\texttt{R} was originally designed as a command language.  
Commands were typed into a text-based input area on the computer screen and the program responded with a response to each command.
The \texttt{R} console opens with information and then a prompt mark  ``>"  it is ready to accept commands
\texttt{R}  is an open source software package, meaning that the code written to implement the various functions can be freely examined and modified.
\texttt{R} can be installed free of charge from the \texttt{R}-project website.
