\subsubsection{Two Sample t test}

The two-sample t test is used to test the hypothesis that two samples may
be assumed to come from distributions with the same mean.

The theory for the two-sample t test is not very different in principle from
that of the one-sample test. Data are now from two groups, $x_{11}, . . . , x_{1n1}$
and $x_{21}, . . . , x_{2n2}$ , which we assume are sampled from the normal distributions
$N(µ_{1}, \sigma^{1}_{2} )$ and
$N(µ_{2}, \sigma^{2}_{2} )$, and it is desired to test the null hypothesis
$\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$. You then calculate

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2}}{S.E.(\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2})}
\]

The TS are <equation here>  
The p-values for both of these tests are 0 and so there is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ and conclude that both 0 and 1 are not 0, i.e. there is a significant linear relationship between x and y. 
Also given are the $R^2$ and $R^2$ adjusted values. Here $R^2 = SSR/SST = 0.8813$ and so $88.13\%$ of the variation in y is being explained by x. 
The final line gives the result of using the ANOVA table to assess the model t.

In SLR, the ANOVA table tests <EQN>The TS is the F value and the critical value and p-values are found
in the F tables with (p - 1) and (n - p) degrees of freedom.

This output gives the p-value = 0, therefore there is enough evidence to reject H0 and conclude that there is a signicant linear relationship between y and x. The full ANOVA table can be accessed using :

\subsubsection{slide236}
Once the model has been tted, must then check the residuals.
The residuals should be independent and normally distributed with
mean of 0 and constant variance.
A Q-Q plot checks the assumption of normality (can also use a
histogram as in MINITAB) while a, plot of the residuals versus fitted values gives an indication as to whether the assumption of constant variance holds.

\section{Introduction to ``R}}
``R} consists of a base package and many additional packages
``R} was originally designed as a command language.  
Commands were typed into a text-based input area on the computer screen and the program responded with a response to each command.
The ``R} console opens with information and then a prompt mark  ``>"  it is ready to accept commands
``R}  is an open source software package, meaning that the code written to implement the various functions can be freely examined and modified.
``R} can be installed free of charge from the ``R}-project website.

\subsubsection{Testing the slope (II)}

You can compute a
t test for that hypothesis simply by dividing the estimate by its standard
error
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}}{S.E.(\hat{\beta})}
\end{equation}
which follows a t distribution on n - 2 degrees of freedom if the true $\beta$ is
zero.

\begin{itemize}
*  The standard $\chi^{2}$ test  in chisq.test works with data in matrix form, like fisher.test does.
*  For a 2 by 2 table, the test is exactly equivalent to prop.test.
