### Combining plots
It is possible to combine two plots. We used the graphical parameters command ``par()`` to create an array. 
Often we just require two plots side by side or above and below. We simply specify the numbers of rows and columns of this array using the ``mfrow`` argument, passed as a vector.

<code>
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(x,y1)			# draw first plot
plot(x,y2)			# draw second plot
par(mfrow=c(1,1))		# reset to default setting.
</code>

### {Plot of single vectors}
If only one vector is specified i.e. ``plot(x)``,  the plot created will simply be a scatter-plot of the values of x against their indices.

$plot(x)$
Suppose we wish to examine a trend that these points represent. We can connect each covariate using a line.

$plot(x, type = "l")$
If we wish to have both lines and points, we would input the following code. 
This is quite useful if we wish to see how a trend develops over time.
$plot(x, type = "b")$
