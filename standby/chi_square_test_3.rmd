\section{Working with Categorical Data}
\subsection{Chi-Square}

The table below shows the relationship between gender and party identification in a US state.


%	   & Democrat &	Independent & Republican & Total \\
%Male   &	279	& 73  &	225 &	577 \\
%Female &	165	& 47  & 191 &	403 \\
%Total  &	444 & 120 &	416	&   980 \\

Test for association between gender and party affiliation at two appropriate levels
and comment on your results.

Set out the null hypothesis that there is no association between method of computation
and gender against the alternative, that there is. Be careful to get these the correct way
round!

H0: There is no association.
H1: There is an association.

Work out the expected values. For example, you should work out the expected value for
the number of males who use no aids from the following: (95/195) Ã— 22 = 10.7.


\section{Probability Distributions}
\subsection{Discrete Probability Distribution}


The two most accessible discrete distributions are the binomial and \textbf{\emph{Poisson}} distributions

\subsubsection{Chi-squared Test}

A $chi^2$ test is carried out on tabular data containing counts, e.g. the
number of animals that died, the number of days of rain, the
number of stocks that grew in value, etc.

Usually have two qualitative variables, each with a number of
levels, and want to determine if there is a relationship between the
two variables, e.g. hair colour and eye colour, social status and
crime rates, house price and house size, gender and left/right
handedness.

The data are presented in a contingency table:
right-handed left-handed TOTAL

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
  & right-handed &left-handed & TOTAL\\\hline
  Male & 43 & 9 & 52 \\
  Female & 44 & 4 & 48 \\
  TOTAL & 87 & 13 & 100 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}


The hypothesis to be tested is
$H0 :$There is no relationship between gender and left/right-handedness
$H1 :$There is a relationship between gender and left/right-handedness
 The values that we collect from our sample are called the observed
(O) frequencies (counts). Now need to calculate the expected (E)
frequencies, i.e. the values we would expect to see in the table, if
H0 was true.
