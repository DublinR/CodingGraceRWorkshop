
### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed using the ``eigen()`` function.  A data object is created.
This is a very important type of matrix analysis, and many will encounter it again in future modules.

```{r}
Y = eigen(A)
names(Y)
"	y$val are the eigenvalues of A
"	y$vec are the eigenvectors of A
```

A particular row can be accessed by specifying the row index , while leaving the column index empty

Info [4,]			# Fourth row of "Info" is called

A sequence of rows can be accessed by specifying a sequence of rows as follows.

Info [10:15,]		# tenth row to fifteenth row of "Info" is called
