\begin{slide}{Factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Categorical data is often used to classify data into various levels or factors.
\item For example, the smoking data could be part of a broader survey on student health issues.
\item In such case, gender and alcohol consumption would be other probable factors.
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item A factor is a special type of vector used to represent
categorical data, e.g. gender, social class, etc. \item Stored
internally as a numeric vector with values 1, 2, ... k, where k is
the number of levels. \item Can have either ordered and unordered
factors. \item A factor with k levels is stored internally
consisting of 2 items; a vector of k integers and a character
vector containing strings describing what the k levels are.
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Factors: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a survey that has data on 200 females and 300
males. \item If the first 200 values are from females and the next 300
values are from males, one way of representing this is to create a
vector
\begin{verbatim}
> gender <- c(rep("female", 200),
  rep("male", 300))
\end{verbatim}
\item 
To change this into a factor
\begin{verbatim}
> gender <- factor(gender)
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Factors: Levels}
\begin{itemize} \item The factor gender is stored internally as '1' for `female'
and `2' for male. \item Each category, i.e. female and male, is
called a level of the factor.  \item To determine the levels of a
factor the function levels() can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
> levels(gender)
[1] "female" "male"
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
