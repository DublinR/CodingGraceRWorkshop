    {Correlation Analysis}
Compute the Pearson correlation for the dependent variable with the respective independent variables.  As part of your report, mention the confidence interval for the correlation estimate
Choose the independent variables with the highest correlation as your candidate variables.
For these independent variables, perform a series of simple linear regression procedures.
<code>
lm(y~x1)
lm(y~x2)
</code>
Comment on the slope and intercept estimates and their respective p-values. Also comment on the coefficient of determination (multiple R squared). Remember to write the regression equations.
Perform a series of multiple linear regressions, using pairs of candidate independent variables.
<code>
lm(y~x1 +x2)
lm(y~x2 +x3)
</code>
Again, comment on the slope and intercept estimates, and their respective p-values.
In this instance, compare each of the models using the coefficient of determinations. Which model explains the data best?
