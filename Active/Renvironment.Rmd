### Time and Date functions

The commands ``Sys.time()`` and ``Sys.Date()`` returns the system's idea of the current date with and without time.
We can perform some simple algebraic calculations to compute time differences (i.e. to find out how long some code took to compile.)

<pre>
<code>
> X1=Sys.time()
> #Wait a few seconds
>
> X2=Sys.time()
> X2-X1
Time difference of 8.439614 secs
>
> Sys.Date() 
[1] "2012-09-01"
</code>
</pre>
