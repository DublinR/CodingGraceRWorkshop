#### {Comparison of variances}


Even though it is possible in R to perform the two-sample t test without
the assumption that the variances are the same, you may still be interested
in testing that assumption, and R provides the var.test function for that
purpose, implementing an F test on the ratio of the group variances. It is
called the same way as texttt{t.test}:.
<code>
> var.test(expend~stature)
