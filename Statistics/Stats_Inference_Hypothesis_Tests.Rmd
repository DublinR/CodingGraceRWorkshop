Two Sample t test}
=========================================================

The two-sample t test is used to test the hypothesis that two samples may
be assumed to come from distributions with the same mean.

The theory for the two-sample t test is not very different in principle from
that of the one-sample test. Data are now from two groups, $x_{11}, . . . , x_{1n1}$
and $x_{21}, . . . , x_{2n2}$ , which we assume are sampled from the normal distributions
$N(µ_{1}, \sigma^{1}_{2} )$ and
$N(µ_{2}, \sigma^{2}_{2} )$, and it is desired to test the null hypothesis
$\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$. You then calculate

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2}}{S.E.(\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X}_{2})}
\]









\section{Introduction to ``R}}
``R} consists of a base package and many additional packages
``R} was originally designed as a command language.  
Commands were typed into a text-based input area on the computer screen and the program responded with a response to each command.
The ``R} console opens with information and then a prompt mark  ``>"  it is ready to accept commands
``R}  is an open source software package, meaning that the code written to implement the various functions can be freely examined and modified.
``R} can be installed free of charge from the ``R}-project website.
