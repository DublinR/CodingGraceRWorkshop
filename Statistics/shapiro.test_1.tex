### Shapiro-Wilk Test

*  We will often be required to determine whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
*  Again, this assumption underpins many statistical models.
*  The null hypothesis is that the data set is normally distributed.
*  The alternative hypothesis is that the data set is not normally distributed.
*  One procedure for testing these hypotheses is the Shapiro-Wilk test, implemented in texttt{R} using the command ``shapiro.test()``.
*  (Remark: You will not be required to compute the test statistic for this test.)

For the data set used previously; $x$ and $y$, we use the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine that both data sets are normally distributed.
<code>

> shapiro.test(x)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  x
W = 0.9474, p-value = 0.6378

> shapiro.test(y)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  y
W = 0.9347, p-value = 0.5273
</code>

*  The normal probability (Q-Q) plot is a very useful tool for determining whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
*  Interpretation is simple. If the points follow the trendline (provided by the second line of texttt{R} code ``qqline()``).
*  One should expect minor deviations. Numerous major deviations would lead the analyst to conclude that the data set is not normally distributed.
*  The Q-Q plot is best used in conjunction with a formal procedure such as the Shapiro-Wilk test.
