The F-Test for Equality of Variance
===============================

*  In this procedure, we determine whether or not two populations have the same variance.
*  The assumption of equal variance of two populations underpins several inference procedures.
*  This assumption is tested by comparing the variance of samples taken from both populations.
*  We will not get into too much detail about that, but concentrate on how to assess equality of variance.
*  The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

[ H_0: sigma^2_1 = sigma^2_2 ]
[ H_1: sigma^2_1 neq sigma^2_2 ]

*  When using texttt{R} it would be convenient to consider the null and alternative in terms of variance ratios.
*  Two data sets have equal variance if the variance ratio is 1.


[ H_0: sigma^2_1 / sigma^2_2 = 1 ]
[ H_1: sigma^2_1 / sigma^2_2 neq 1 ]

%----------------------------------------%
% - x=c(14,13,16,20,12,18,11,09,13,11)
% - y=c(15,13,18,20,10,17,23,11,10)
%----------------------------------------%



The test statistic is the ratio of the variances for both data sets.
[ TS = frac{s^2_x}{s^2_y} ]
The standard deviations would be provided in the texttt{R} code. 
*  Sample standard deviation for data set $x$ = 3.40
*  Sample standard deviation for data set $y$ = 4.63

To compute the test statistic.
[ TS = frac{3.40^2}{4.63^2} = frac{11.56}{21.43} = 0.5394 ]

        F test to compare two variances

data:  X and Y
F = 0.5394, num df = 9, denom df = 8, p-value = 0.3764
alternative hypothesis: 
 true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.1237892 2.2125056
sample estimates:
ratio of variances
         0.5393782
</code>



*  The p-value is 0.3764 (top right), above the threshold level of 0.0250.
*  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
*  We can assume that there is no significant difference in sample variances. Therefore we can assume that both populations have equal variance.
*  Additionally the $95%$ confidence interval (0.1237, 2.2125) contains the $H_0$ value i.e. 1.
