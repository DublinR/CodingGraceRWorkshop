#### {Analysis of residuals}
Perform an analysis of regression residuals ( you can pick the best regression model from last <p>
### ).
Are the residuals normally distributed?
	Histogram /  Boxplot / QQ plot / Shapiro Wilk Test
Also you can plot the residuals to check that there is constant variance.
<code>
y=rnorm(10)
x=rnorm(10)
fit1=lm(y~x)
res.fit1 = resid(fit1)
plot(res.fit1)
</code>
