* The cor() function in R can be extended to provide the significance testing required. 
* The function is ``cor.test()".
\begin{verbatim}
> cor(x,y)
[1] 0.9581898

\end{verbatim}
* For this test, the null hypothesis is that the true correlation coefficient is zero.
* The alternative is that the true value is not zero, and a linear relationship exists.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}

> cor.test(x,y)

        Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  x and y
t = 10.5897, df = 10, p-value = 9.379e-07
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.8537967 0.9885056
sample estimates:
      cor
0.9581898

\begin{slide}{Inference for correlation (contd)}
\begin{itemize}
* The p-value for this hypothesis test is 9.379e-07.
* As this is much smaller than out threshold of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis.
* There is a linear relationship between x and y.
* Notice the alternative hypothesis was expressed in the output.
* Also notice that a 95\% confidence interval was given for the correlation coefficient.
