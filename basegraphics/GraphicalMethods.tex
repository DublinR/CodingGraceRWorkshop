\section{Plot of single vectors}
If only one vector is specified i.e. \texttt{plot(x)},  the plot created will simply be a scatter-plot of the values of x against their indices.

$plot(x)$
Suppose we wish to examine a trend that these points represent. We can connect each covariate using a line.

$plot(x, type = "l")$
If we wish to have both lines and points, we would input the following code. This is quite useful if we wish to see how a trend develops over time.
$plot(x, type = "b")$
