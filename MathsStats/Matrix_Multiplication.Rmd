
Matrix Multiplication
To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; "%*%".
If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
A * B  		#Element-wise multiplication
A %*% B  	#Matrix multiplication
We can compute crossproducts using the crossprod () command. If only one matrix is used it
\begin{framed}
	\begin{verbatim}
	crossprod(A,B) 		# A'B
	crossprod(A) 			# A'A
	\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
Diagonals
The diag() command is a very versatile function for using matrices.
It can be used to create a diagonal matrix with elements of a vector in the principal diagonal. For an existing matrix, it can be used to return a vector containing the elements of the principal diagonal.


Most importantly, if k is a scalar, diag() will create a k x k identity matrix.

\begin{framed}
	\begin{verbatim}
	Vec2=c(1,2,3)
	diag(Vec2)	#	Constructs a diagonal matrix based on values of Vec2
	diag(A)	#        Returns diagonal elements of A as a vector
	diag(3)	#	creates a 3 x 3 identity matrix
	diag(diag(A)) #  	Diagonal matrix D of matrix A ( Jacobi Method)
	\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
Determinants, Inverse Matrices and solving Linear systems
To compute the determinant of a square matrix, we simply use the det() command
det(A)
det(B)
To find the inverse of a square matrix, we use the solve() command, specifying only the matrix in question
solve(A)

To solve a system of linear equations in the form Ax=b , where A is a square matrix, and b is a column vector of known values, we use the solve() command to determine the values of the unknown vector x.
b=vec2  # from before
solve(A, b)
Row and Column Statistics.
Statistic on the rows and columns can easily be computed if required.
%rowMeans(A)  # Returns vector of row means.
%rowSums(A)  # Returns vector of row sums.
%colMeans(A)  # Returns vector of column means.
%colSums(A)  # Returns vector of coumn means.
