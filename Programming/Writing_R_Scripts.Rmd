\section{Vector types}
``R} operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the
vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of
Numbers or characters.

\begin{itemize}
*  Numeric vectors
*  Character vectors
*  Logical vectors
*  (also complex number vectors and colour vectors)
\end{itemize}

To create a vector, use the assignment operator and the concatenate function.
For numeric vectors, the values are simply numbers.

<code>
># week8.r
>NumVec<-c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4)
</code>

Alternatively we can use the ``assign()`` command

For character vectors, the values are simply characters, specified with
quotation marks.A logical vectors is a vector whose elements are TRUE, FALSE or NA

<code>
>CharVec<-c(``blue", ``green", ``yellow")
>LogVec<-c(TRUE, FALSE)
</code>
