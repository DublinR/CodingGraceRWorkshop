*  For example, the smoking data could be part of a broader survey on student health issues.
*  In such case, gender and alcohol consumption would be other probable factors.

*  A factor is a special type of vector used to represent
categorical data, e.g. gender, social class, etc. *  Stored
internally as a numeric vector with values 1, 2, ... k, where k is
the number of levels. *  Can have either ordered and unordered
factors. *  A factor with k levels is stored internally
consisting of 2 items; a vector of k integers and a character
vector containing strings describing what the k levels are.

\begin{slide}{Factors: Example}

*  Consider a survey that has data on 200 females and 300
males. *  If the first 200 values are from females and the next 300
values are from males, one way of representing this is to create a
vector
\begin{verbatim}
> gender <- c(rep("female", 200),
  rep("male", 300))
\end{verbatim}
*  
To change this into a factor
\begin{verbatim}
> gender <- factor(gender)
\end{verbatim}


 *  The factor gender is stored internally as '1' for `female'
and `2' for male. *  Each category, i.e. female and male, is
called a level of the factor.  *  To determine the levels of a
factor the function levels() can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
> levels(gender)
[1] "female" "male"
\end{verbatim}
