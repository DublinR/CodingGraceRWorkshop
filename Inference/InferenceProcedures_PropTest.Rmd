 9 Inference Procedures




\subsection{Hypothesis test of Proportion}
This procedure is used to assess whether an assumed proportion is supported by evidence. For two tailed tests, the null hypothesis states that the population proportion  ?? has a specified value, with the alternative stating that ?? has a different value. 

The hypotheses are typically as follows:   

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Ho] : $\pi = 0.50$
	\item[Ha] : $\pi \neq 0.50$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example}
A manufacturer is interested in whether people can tell the difference between a new formulation of a soft drink and the original formulation. The new formulation is cheaper to produce so if people cannot tell the difference, the new formulation will be manufactured. 

A sample of 100 people is taken. Each person is given a taste of both formulations and asked to identify the original. Sixty-two percent of the subjects correctly identified the new formulation. Is this proportion significantly different from $50\%$? 

The first step in hypothesis testing is to specify the null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. In testing proportions, the null hypothesis is that $\pi$, the proportion in the population, is equal to 0.5. The alternate hypothesis is $\pi \neq 0.5$. 

The computed p-values is compared to the pre-specified significance level of $5\%$. Since the p-value (0.0214) is less than the significance level of 0.05, the effect is statistically significant. 

\begin{verbatim}
> prop.test(62,100,0.5)

1-sample proportions test with continuity correction

data:  62 out of 100, null probability 0.5 
X-squared = 5.29, df = 1, p-value = 0.02145
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
0.5170589 0.7136053 
sample estimates:
p 
0.62 
\end{verbatim}

Since the effect is significant, the null hypothesis is rejected. It is concluded that the proportion of people choosing the original formulation is greater than 0.50. 

This result might be described in a report as follows: 

\begin{quote}
	The proportion of subjects choosing the original formulation (0.62) was significantly greater than 0.50, with p-value = 0.021.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Chi-squared Test}

A $chi^2$ test is carried out on tabular data containing counts, e.g. the
number of animals that died, the number of days of rain, the
number of stocks that grew in value, etc.

Usually have two qualitative variables, each with a number of
levels, and want to determine if there is a relationship between the
two variables, e.g. hair colour and eye colour, social status and
crime rates, house price and house size, gender and left/right
handedness.

The data are presented in a contingency table:
right-handed left-handed TOTAL

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
	& right-handed &left-handed & TOTAL\\\hline
	Male & 43 & 9 & 52 \\
	Female & 44 & 4 & 48 \\
	TOTAL & 87 & 13 & 100 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}


The hypothesis to be tested is
$H0 :$There is no relationship between gender and left/right-handedness
$H1 :$There is a relationship between gender and left/right-handedness
The values that we collect from our sample are called the observed
(O) frequencies (counts). Now need to calculate the expected (E)
frequencies, i.e. the values we would expect to see in the table, if
H0 was true.






%------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Two Sample Tests}


All of the previous hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be
extended to the two-sample case.

The same assumptions apply, i.e. data are normally distributed in
each population and we may want to test if the mean in one
population is the same as the mean in the other population, etc.

Normality can be checked using histograms, boxplots and Q-Q
plots as before. The Anderson-Darling test can be used on
each group of data also.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

This can be carried out in R by hand:

\footnotesize \begin{verbatim}
>obs.vals <- matrix(c(43,9,44,4), nrow=2, byrow=T)
>row.tots <- apply(obs.vals, 1, sum)
>col.tots <- apply(obs.vals, 2, sum)
>exp.vals <- row.tots%o%col.tots/sum(obs.vals)
>TS <- sum((obs.vals-exp.vals)^2/exp.vals)
>TS
>[1] 1.777415
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
