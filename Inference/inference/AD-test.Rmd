\begin{verbatim}

        Anderson-Darling normality test

data:  x
A = 0.3859, p-value = 0.3325
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{The Shapiro Wilk normality test}
The Shapiro Wilk is another commonly used procedure used to test normality.
Again, the null hypothesis is that the data set is normally distributed.
\begin{verbatim}
> x=rnorm(40)
> shapiro.test(x)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  x
W = 0.9601, p-value = 0.1689
\end{verbatim}
Here, the P-value is greater than 1\%. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.

\begin{slide}{A-D test: conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item The null hypothesis is that data set is normally distributed.
\item The alternative hypothesis is that it is not normally distributed.
\item The p-value (0.3325) is greater than than 1\%.
\item Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
