Installing Packages
===================================================
Thanks for your interest in the Coding Grace `R` workshop. 

In advance of the workshop, it would be great if you could install R and also install some `R` packages that we will use on the day.

All you have to do is to open R (making sure that you are connected to the internet), and run the following piece of code ( you can copy aand paste this following code segment)


```{r}

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```
