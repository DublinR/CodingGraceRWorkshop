### {Embedded Datasets}
Several data sets – intended as learning tools – are automatically installed when texttt{R} is installed. Many more are installed within packages to complement learning to use those packages.  One of these is the famous ``textit{iris}" data set, which is used in many data mining exercises.

         * To see what data sets are available – type texttt{data()}.
         * To load a data set, simply type in the name of the data set. 
         * To specify that a specific data set is to be used for analysis, use the command texttt{attach()}.



Some data sets are very large. To just see the first few rows, we use the head() function.
