#### Listing all items in a workspace

To list all items in an \texttt{R} environment, we use the \texttt{ls()} function. This provides a list of all data objects  accessible.

<pre><code>
> ls()
 [1] "a"          "A"          "authors"    "b"          "books"     
 [6] "C"          "D"          "ex1"        "Gerb"       "Lst"       
[11] "m"          "m1"         "op"         "presidents" "r"         
[16] "showSmooth" "sm"         "sm.3RS"     "sm2"        "sm3"       
[21] "Trig"       "Vec1"       "x"          "X"          "x.at"      
[26] "x1"         "x2"         "x3R"        "y"          "Y"         
[31] "y.at"      
</code></pre>
